For more information on setting up jenkins CI with this build configuration please visit

http://jenkins-php.org/installation.html

You only need to install jenkins with the required plugins (also install the git and git-client plugins in addition to
the ones listed on the page), import the php_template, and configure the build via the jenkins web interface.
All the configuration for ant and the tools is already taken care of.
